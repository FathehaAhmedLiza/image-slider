## ❓ FAQ

**Q: How do I find the slider ID?**  
A: In the slider edit screen, check the URL for `post=123` or enable the “ID” column from **Screen Options** in the list view.  

**Q: Does it need jQuery?**  
A: Nope  The slider is written in pure JavaScript on the front-end. (Only the admin UI uses WordPress media & jQuery for sorting.)
